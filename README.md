RefreshActionProvider, a a project library containing an action item (a button) which will be replaced by a progress indicator, under a RefreshActionProvider class. The library contains also a RefreshableListFragment that your fragments can extend to ease its use. Try the demo app or fork the project!

ps: the data comes from a script which sometimes will return a list of elements and sometimes will be empty for you to test all use cases.
